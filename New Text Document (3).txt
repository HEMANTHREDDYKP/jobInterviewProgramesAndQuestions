1.inner join or Equijoin
2.left outer join 
3.right outer join
4.full outer join
5.natural join
6. cross join or carteasion join


 1. inner join 

  it is used to get the matching records from both the tables

  syntax :
      select *
      from table1 t1  join table2 t2
      on t1.id=t2.id; 

e.g --->




2. left outer join 

  it is used to get the matching record from both the tables and unmatched records from left table

 syntax:
      select * 
      from table1 t1 left join table2 t2
      on t1.id=t2.id

e.g --->



3. right outer join 

  it is used to get the matching record from both the tables and unmatched records from right table

 syntax:
      select * 
      from table1 t1 right join table2 t2
      on t1.id=t2.id

e.g --->



4. full outer join 

  it is used to get the matching record from both the tables and unmatched records from both the tables

 syntax:
      select * 
      from table1 t1 full join table2 t2
      on t1.id=t2.id

e.g --->



5.cross join
    
   each record of left table is mapped to all the records of the right table
   i.e 1st record of left table is multiplied to all the record of right table and so on

 syntax: 

      select *
      from table1 t1 cross join table2 t2;

e.g --->



6. natural join 
  
    if the two tables are having some relation i.e if both the tables
   have the column with same name then it behaves as inner join if
    two tables are not having any relation i.e if both the tables
   do not have column with same name then it behaves as cross join


   syntax:
        select * 
        from table1 t1 natural join table t2;

e.g ---> 

  
Note : in sql null is not equal to null

-------------limit(starting point,number of records)-----------
Note: index starts from 0


select sal from emp order by desc limit 1,1------>get 2nd max sal
select sal from emp order by desc limit 99,1------>get 2nd max sal



                                indexes
                               ---------
indexes are database objects which helps in retriving records quickely and more efficently.

column indexes can be created for both tables and views,By declaring the column as an index within a table/view, the user can
can access those records quickely by executing the index

syntax :


create index index_name
on table_Name (clo1,col2);
